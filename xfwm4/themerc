# Notes: Initially adapted from mx-comfort-dark by MXLinux, and influenced by several other themes,
#        such as Default, Numix, Kokodi, and Borders by Richard Wurth. 
#      
#      -  I wanted colored borders to differentiate the active window without being obnoxious.
#      -  It uses the highlight color from the current GTK theme for the border color. 
#      -  The borders are thick so they are easier to "grab" with the mouse.
#      -  Buttons go wherever the user places them via XFCE Window Manager Style tab.
#
#    In my testing so far, it works well with both light and dark themes.
