Initially adapted from mx-comfort-dark by MXLinux, and influenced by several other themes, such as Default, Numix, Kokodi, and Borders by Richard Wurth. 
      
      -  I wanted colored borders to differentiate the active window without being too obnoxious.
      -  It uses the highlight color from the current GTK theme for the border color. 
      -  The borders are thick so they are easier to "grab" with the mouse.
      -  Buttons go wherever the user places them via XFCE Window Manager Style tab.

In my testing so far, it works well with most light and dark themes.  I don't like the result with Breeze Dark GTK theme because it picks up lighter borders on the inactive window.

To install, untar in your ~/.themes folder, or /usr/share/themes (or equivalent) if you want it available to all users.

If you find any issues or have any suggestions, send me a note.  s a w s e d g e g m a i l
